this is just a simple telnet chat room i made recently using
ANSI C (which is why im not using getaddrinfo here)

its a small chunk of code from my main chat server i use to talk
with friends .3

USAGE
	clone repository first
	$ git clone https://github.com/yourluckystar/telnet_chat_room.git

	then you can just cd into the dir and run make
	$ make

	start server and connect
	$ ./server
	$ telnet localhost 11941
